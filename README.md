Module 2 - VBA Challenge

The essential purpose of this challenge is to demonstrate a good understanding of VBA and its applications to real-life scenarios.
  
  In this challenge, we are firstly, identifying the variety of different 'tickers', the yearly    change and the percentage change from the opening price to the closing price of a given year,    and the total stock volume. The yearly change and percent change columns are also conditional formatted to ensure readability is simple when determining which ticker has a positive or a negative increase (below 0 = red; above 0 = green). 

  With this information, we are able to discern the relationship between each 'ticker' and its   development throughout the year in terms of its changes in stock volume. 
  
  Additionally, we are also identifying which 'ticker' has the greatest percent increase, the greatest   per cent decrease, and the greatest total stock volume.
